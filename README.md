3. Problem to Be Solved by the Product or Service:
ExisLng social media plaNorms, such as Facebook, frequently impose restricLons on
content related to the PalesLnian cause. This includes deleLng posts, limiLng reach, or
even suspending accounts. Such acLons suppress freedom of expression and make it
diﬃcult for PalesLnians and their allies to share their stories and advocate for jusLce.
In the current digital landscape, there is no dedicated plaNorm where users can freely
discuss sensiLve issues like PalesLne without fear of censorship. This highlights the need
